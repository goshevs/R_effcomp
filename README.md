# Effcomp

This is a set of programs which compute contrasts after effect margins estimated using the effects package in R. 

Currently, two files are included in this repo:
- effcomp.R -- contains all R functions 
- examples.R -- contains examples of usage of the functions found in effcomp.R

More details to follow shortly.
